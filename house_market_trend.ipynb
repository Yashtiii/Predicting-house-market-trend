    "- **Regression:** Regression predicts a continuous number. It gives real values as outcome.\n",
    "- **Classification:** Classification predicts a categorical label. It gives a label as outcome.\n",
    "- **Target Variable Analysis:** Here we examine the features of a target variable which is dependent in nature. It is necessary because once we have examined what our target variable is like then we can set the other data accordingly to get good results in analysis. It also involved transformation. This step profiles the target variable to align preprocessing, transformation, and modeling strategies for better results\n",
    "- **Advanced data preprocessing:** It is like data processing, here we apply even more advanced strategies to pre process data.\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering:** Here we create new features using the pre-existing ones to get better information or underlying information that our data holds.\n",
    "- **Categorical Encoding:** When we have categorical values in our columns and we change it to numrical ones then it is known as categorical encoding.\n",
    "- **Model Building:** It is the process of training and validating an algorithm with the use dependent and independent variables.\n",
    "- **Model Evaluation:** Once our model is training then we test our model to evaluate the accuracy of our model, that is known as model evaluation."
